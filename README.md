# Mac Miller - Best Day Ever
I never take a day off

Work around the clock, my engineer gettin' paid off

Rock like Aesop, light the weed and take off

So high I cannot see, Adolf

Now I got these rappers all breakin' up a sweat

Because every time I get up on the mike, everything is in order.

And I learned it from the best, always dressed in somethin' fresh

Lookin' for a little dime, big butt and nice chest

Yes, they heard I used to rock Guess

But today I'm rockin' sweats that ain't in the stores ever because they're super old!!

Travel back in time, I'm in a vortex, cause I have more flex! 

Tryna to make it work out, think I need more reps

Used to take a bus, now the boy board jets

'Cause K.I.D.S. got me buzzin' like a fuckin' hornet

They say I got next, tell them that I got now

It's all Disney boy, my family Proud

Make 'em say, "Ow, " make 'em say, "Oh"

The hoes that tell me "yes", the same ones that tell you "No"

Woah, I ain't just an Average Joe, way above the average flow

Boy, my life is Most Dope

## Lyrics
We're no strangers to love<br>
You know the rules and so do I<br>
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of<br>
You wouldn't get this from any other guy<br>

I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling<br>
Gotta make you understand<br>
Never gonna give you up<br>
Never gonna let you down<br>
Never gonna run around and desert you<br>
Never gonna make you cry<br>
Never gonna say goodbye<br>
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br>

We've known each other for so long<br>
Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it<br>
Inside we both know what's been going on<br>
We know the game and we're gonna play it<br>
And if you ask me how I'm feeling<br>
Help I'm trapped in this file, please let me out<br>

Never gonna give you up<br>
Never gonna let you down<br>
Never gonna run around and desert you<br>
Never gonna make you cry<br>
Never gonna say goodbye<br>
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br>

Never gonna give you up<br>
Never gonna let you down<br>
Never gonna run around and desert you<br>
Never gonna make you cry<br>
Never gonna say goodbye<br>
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br>

Never gonna give, never gonna give
(Give you up)<br>
We've known each other for so long<br>
Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it<br>
Inside we both know what's been going on<br>
We know the game and we're gonna play it<br>
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling<br>
Gotta make you understand<br>

Never gonna give you up<br>
Never gonna let you down<br>
Never gonna run around and desert you<br>
Never gonna make you cry<br>
Never gonna say goodbye<br>
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br>

Never gonna give you up<br>
Never gonna let you down<br>
Never gonna run around and desert you<br>
Never gonna make you cry<br>
Never gonna say goodbye<br>
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br>

Never gonna give you up<br>
Never gonna let you down<br>
Never gonna run around and desert you<br>
Never gonna make you cry<br>
Never gonna say goodbye<br>
